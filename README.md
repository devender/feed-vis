A very simple Feed Visualizer
=============================

Features
--------
*   will handle rss and atom feeds
*   when user clicks on a feed will open the link in the browser

Future
-------
*   Comes preloaded with Hacker News and Reddit/programming, can only be changed if you have the source code, I would like to add a feature so that user can edit the feeds.
