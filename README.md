A very simple Feed Visualizer
=============================

To use please click on this [link](http://github.com/devender/feed-vis/raw/gh-pages/feed-vis.jnlp), it will download a JNLP file which can be opened as a Java Web start app. 
Features
--------
*   will handle rss and atom feeds
*   when user clicks on a feed will open the link in the browser

Future
-------
*   Comes preloaded with Hacker News and Reddit/programming, can only be changed if you have the source code, I would like to add a feature so that user can edit the feeds.
*   The number of stories shown is set to 3, this should be something that the user can change.
*   Ability to load OPML files
